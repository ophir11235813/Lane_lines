# Identify left and right lane lines from a raw highway video feed

### Overview: 
Consider two cases: 

1. Base case: straight, sunny, shadow-less, constant surface-color road with clear markings and no nearby cars
2. Challenging case: curved road, with shadows, variable surface-colors, nearby cars, and unclear markings

In both cases, the goal is to identify and highlight the left- and right-lane markings of a highway, given a raw video feed. 

### How to run the code

There are two IPython notebooks, one for each case:

1. Ophir_Samson_Lane_Markings.ipynb 
2. Ophir_Samson_Lane_Lines_Challenge.ipynb

Each are fully annoted to describe the methods used within.
